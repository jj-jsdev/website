    <h2>How to use Git</h2>
    <p>Git is a widely used version control system that allows you to track changes in your codebase. It is particularly useful
    for collaborating with other developers and managing different versions of your project. To use Git, you'll first need
    to install it on your computer. Once installed, you can initialize a new Git repository in your project directory using
    the git init command. From there, you can add files to the repository using git add, commit changes using git commit,
    and push your changes to a remote repository using git push</p>

    <h2>How to code in a JavaScript file</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a popular programming language used for web development. To write JavaScript code in a file, you'll first
    need to create a new file with a .js extension, such as script.js. You can then open the file in a code editor of your
    choice. Inside the file, you can write JavaScript code to perform various tasks, such as manipulating the HTML content
    of a webpage, handling user interactions, or making API requests. Once you've written your JavaScript code, you can
    include the script in an HTML file using the
    "script" tag </p>
    
    <h2 style="color: #ffb84b;">Improved on my HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p>HTML and CSS are the building blocks of web development. HTML is used to structure the content of a webpage, while CSS
    is used to style and position the elements on the page. To improve on my HTML and CSS skills, I started by learning
    the basic syntax and tags of HTML, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. For CSS, I learnt about
    selectors, properties, and values to style my HTML elements. Additionally, I did a lot of practice by building small projects
    or following tutorials to gain hands-on experience and improve my understanding of these technologies.</p>
